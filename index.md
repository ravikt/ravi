I work at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. In the recent past, I have worked in developing data-driven models for fundamental and applied problems in computer vision. Some of those include scene flow estimation, visual odometry, and object tracking. Most of these work can be accessed through my github account. I have also worked in the design and analysis of compliant mechanism for a medical simulation device. I have a background in Physics through my undergraduate studies. 

<!--I maintain scholarly interest in strategic and defense studies in the context of Indian national security. If you think that I can learn a thing or two from you on this subject, then please feel free to invite me for tea. I have an archive of now discontinued magazine Defence Watch published between 2010-14. If you need access to those for your research purpose, then I can help. My education was heavily subsidized by Indian taxpayers. I welcome volunteering opportunities for any project working towards making education accessible and affordable in India.
