I work at Ford Motor Company, Chennai. My work is on computer vision and machine learning. I completed my MS by Research from Indian Institute of Information Technology Sri City, Chittoor. My research was on developing deep neural network models for scene flow estimation. Between 2015 to 2016, I worked at Multidisciplinary and Multiscale Devices and Design Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Before that I spent four years at National Institute of Technology, Calicut for my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics. Thank you for visiting.
