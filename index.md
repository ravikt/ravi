I work at Ford Motor Company, Chennai. My work is on computer vision and machine learning. Before joining Ford, I completed my MS by Research from Indian Institute of Information Technology Sri City, Chittoor. During my research, I developed deep neural network models for scene flow estimation. For a year, I worked at Multidisciplinary and Multiscale Devices and Design Lab, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Before that I spent four years at National Institute of Technology, Calicut for my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics. Thank you for visiting.
